This repository contains a [UiPath][uipath] library project. It is used by the
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at [Flinders University][flinders]. It
provides common activities used by our projects.

## Documentation ##

Documentation on each activity is available in the [wiki][wiki].

## Continuous Integration ##

Commits to branches in this repository automatically trigger a Github Action. 
The script automatically checks the project for lint errors using the the
[rpa-lint][rpa-lint] app developed by the team at [Flinders University][flinders].

## Acknowledgements ##

The RPA team acknowledges the assistance of [RPA Solutions][rpa-solutions] in
the development of an earlier pre-release version of this library.
